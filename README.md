# Solidity 101

This repository contains various Solidity contracts(topic wise)to help you understand different aspects of Solidity programming. Please note that some examples may use multiple contracts without linking(inherit)them. This is done intentionally to simplify the explanation of topics.And some may have some silly errors that can be solved easily.Show your skills

## Important Notes

1. **Multiple Contracts**: In some cases, multiple contracts are used without linking. These may not work properly as standalone examples. To make them work:
   - Move the contract that needs to be executed(remix )first to the top (not ideal, but useful for simple code and learning purposes).
   - Ensure that the contracts are properly inherited for real code.

2.**Possible Errors**: Some files may cause errors because certain elements may have been mixed up. However, individual topics are perfectly designed to understand, so any errors are just due to the mash-up. If someone from you is interested to solve those by having individual topics still understandable. you're welcome. 

## Getting Started

To get started with Solidity 101:
1. Clone the repository.
