//1.state
//In Solidity, state-changing functions do not return values when called via a transaction (because transactions do not return data; they execute changes in the blockchain). {that means when i will try to change the state variable and also try to return a while in a transaction the return don't work.}

//Pure , View , nothing =>depends on state variable
